# neural-networks-from-scratch
This repo contains implementations of machine learning models built from scratch.

This notebook, `simple_neural_network_iris_example.ipynb`, demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network trained on the Iris dataset. It covers data preprocessing (loading and one-hot encoding), splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training a neural network with a hidden layer, and evaluating its performance by calculating accuracy on the test set.
