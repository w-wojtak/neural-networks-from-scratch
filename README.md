# neural-networks-from-scratch
This repo contains implementations of machine learning models built from scratch.

This notebook, `simple_neural_network_iris_example.ipynb`, demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network trained on the Iris dataset. It covers data preprocessing (loading and one-hot encoding), splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training a neural network with a hidden layer, and evaluating its performance by calculating accuracy on the test set. 

For a detailed explanation of this implementation, check out my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@w.wojtak/building-a-simple-neural-network-from-scratch-09c72f25b8b1).
